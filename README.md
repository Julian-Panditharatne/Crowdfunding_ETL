# Crowdfunding_ETL

**Project Overview:**

Built an ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After the data was manipulated using those methods, we created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create a database ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) and a table schema. Finally, the CSV files were then "uploaded" into a PostgreSQL Database.

**Tools:**

Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, QuickDBD and PostgreSQL:

**Summary:**

Extracted and transformed data from CSV files

Created a PostgreSQL database and tables using an ERD

Loaded the CSV files into a PostegreSQL database

Query the data to and generate reports
